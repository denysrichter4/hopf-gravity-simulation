# Hopf Fibration & Emergent Gravity Simulation

This repository contains the source code used in the paper "Emergent Dynamics in Hopf Fibrations".

## What it does

Simulates N-Body interactions in a 4D geometry ($S^3$) stereographically projected into 3D, demonstrating:

- **Emergent Gravity** ($1/r^2$).
- **Relativistic Time Dilation** (Computational Lag).

## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python simulation.py
```
